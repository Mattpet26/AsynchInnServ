# Asynch-Inn

**Author**: Matthew Petersen
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
.NET MVC Principles. I created a database for hotels, rooms and ammenities offered.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository down to your local machine with: Git clone clonedRepoHere
Hit the green play button and wait for your browser window to open
You will be brought to 'Hello World'. But you can try /api/Hotels to view all the hotels in my api! How neat!

## Example
![image](getRooms)
![image](getAmmenities)
![image](getHotels)

## Architecture
C# + .NET

## Change Log
